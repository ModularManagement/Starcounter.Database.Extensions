# Starcounter.Database Extensions
Starcounter.Database Extensions is an open-source set of APIs for commonly used programming patterns and utilities, extending [Starcounter.Database](https://docs.starcounter.io/) with features such as an `OnDelete` callback pattern, and a pre-commit hook implementation, allowing applications to register delegates to be invoked for when an instance of a specified type is modified in a transaction.

These extensions can be used "as is", or as a way to learn how to extend top-level Starcounter services using [decoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern).

See [samples](./samples) to learn more.
